# Scissor-Lift

A hands-on mechanical engineering project focused on the design, fabrication, and testing of a scissor lift prototype. The system uses a fixed bolt and movable nut mechanism to achieve stable vertical motion, with a focus on practical fabrication and performance analysis.

##  Project Highlights

- Designed and fabricated a **mechanical scissor lift** using a **fixed boltâ€“movable nut system** to control vertical extension.
- Manufactured components from **mild steel**, applying workshop techniques such as **cutting, drilling, lathe machining, and milling**.
- Assembled the structure with precision to ensure **alignment, smooth motion**, and mechanical durability.
- Evaluated **lift performance under varying loads**, analyzed weight-bearing capacity, and tested stability at different extension levels.

## Tools & Techniques

- Mechanical design (linkage systems and bolt-based control)
- Fabrication techniques: cutting, drilling, turning (lathe), milling
- Material: Mild steel (MS)
- Load and stability testing

##  Purpose

This project demonstrates the **practical implementation of vertical lifting mechanisms**, with an emphasis on structural design, mechanical control systems, and load performance evaluation.
